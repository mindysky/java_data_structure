# Effective Java

## Item 15 minimize the accessibility of classes and members

信息隐藏（information hiding）或者封装（encapsulation）:

hide its internal data and other implementation details from other components

components then communicate only through their APIs and are oblivious to each others' inner workings.

一个设计良好的组件隐藏了它所有的实现细节，把它的API与它的实现清晰地隔离开来，然后组件之间通过它们各自的API进行交互，彼此之间不知道别的组件内部是如何工作的

**Advantage of information hiding**

1. Decouples the components, allow them to be developed, tested,   optimized,used, understood and modified in isolation.
2. Eases the burden of maintainance as components can be understood more quickly and debugged or replaced without harming other components
3. Enable effective performance tuning
4. Increase  software  reuse
5. Decrease the risk in building large systems

**Access control**

* Make each class or member as inaccessible as possible
* For top-level classes and interfaces  only 2 possible access level: package-private & public
* If a class or interface can be made package-private , it should be.
* If a top-level class or interface used by only one class, consider making the class a private static nested class

For members: fields, methods,nested class, nested interface

**Access modifiers:**

- **私有的（private）**— The member is accessible only from the top-level class where it is declared.
- **包级私有（package-private）**—The member is accessible from any class in the package where it is declared. Technically known as default access, this is the access level you get if no access modifier is specified (except for interface members, which are public by default).
- **受保护的（protected）**—The member is accessible from subclasses of the class where it is declared (subject to a few restrictions [JLS, 6.6.2]) and from any class in the package where it is declared.
- **公有的（public）**—The member is accessible from anywhere.

**Instance fields of public classes should rarely be public**

公有类的实体域（非静态域）一般情况都不应该是公有的

**Classes with public mutable fields are not generally thread-safe**

**it is wrong for a class to have a public static final array field, or an accesort that return such a field**

client will be able to modify th contents of the array,  security holes, 2 ways to solve it:

1. make the array private & add a public immutable list:

   ```java
   private static final Thing[] PRIVATE = {....}
   public static final List<Thing> VALUSES  = Collections.unmodifiableList(Arrays.asList(PRIVATE ))

2. make the array private and add a public mehod that return a copy of a private array:

   ```
   private static final Thing[] PRIVATE = {....}
   public static final Thing[] values(){
   	return PRIVATE.clone();
   }
   ```

module  => a group of packages

## Item 16 In public classes, use accessor methods ,not public fields

not offer benefits of encapsulation

accessor  methods: getters

mutator methods: setters

If a class is accessible outside its package, provide accessor methods to prevent the flexibility to change the class's internal 

representation.

if a class is package-private or is a private nested class, there is nothing inherently wrong with exposing its data fields

## Item17 Minimize mutability

Five rules:

1. Don’t provide methods that modify the object’s state
2. Ensure that the class can’t be extended.  making the class final
3. Make all fields final
4. Make all fields private
5. Ensure exclusive access to any mutable components. 

**Advantage**:

1. Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe; they require no synchronization.
2. Immutable objects can be shared freely.
3. Not only can you share immutable objects, but they can share their internals.
4. Immutable objects make great building blocks for other objects.
5. Immutable objects provide failure atomicity for free.  失败原子机制，不可能出现临时的不一致性

**Disadvantage**：

 - Immutable classes require a separate object for each distinct value.

   reason: create object can be costly, especial larger

   mutable companion class: StringBuilder

   和 String 类不同的是，StringBuffer 和 StringBuilder 类的对象能够被多次的修改，并且不产生新的未使用对象。

   字符串连接: 方便和直接的方式是通过"+"符号来实现，但是这种方式达到目的的效率比较低，且每执行一次都会创建一个String对象，即耗时，又浪费空间, 使用StringBuilder类就可以避免这种问题的发生。

**Summary:**

1. Classes should be immutable unless there’s a very good reason to make them mutable. 
2. If a class cannot be made immutable, limit its mutability as much as possible.
3. Declare every field private final unless there’s a good reason to do otherwise.
4. Constructors should create fully initialized objects with all of their invariants established

## Item 20: Prefer interfaces to abstract classes（接口优于抽象类）
